# Detecting Authorization Vulnerabilities via LLM-Assisted Semantic Access Control Modelin

## Benchmark

We construct a new dataset, AuthVul, which contains 230 historical authorization vulnerabilities extracted from representative open-source Java Web applications and 19 vulnerabilities extracted from industrial applications. Due to confidentiality constraints, the detailed vulnerability information of these industrial applications cannot be publicly released. The open-source data is available [AuthVul](https://https://github.com/LLM4AVD/LLM4AVD/blob/main/benchmark.json)

## Results

The following table shows the vulnerability detection results of LLM4AVD on each open-source application:
